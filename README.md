## Introduction
In the face of South Korea's declining birth rate, the baby products market has surprisingly doubled in value from 2015 to 2020. Coupang has become a significant player in this market, introducing innovative marketing strategies and capitalizing on their fast delivery services to enhance customer experience.

## Objectives
The goal of this study is to identify popular baby products on Coupang and the factors influencing consumer purchase patterns, such as product features, customer reviews, ratings, and delivery speed, to gain insights into current market trends and consumer preferences.

## Dataset Preprocessing
- **Column Name Standardization**: Standardize all column names for consistency.
- **Item Name Splitting**: Separate the base name from additional information.
- **Price Data Preprocessing**: Convert price information to a numeric format.
- **Discount Rate Processing**: Clean up discount data for analysis.
- **Delivery Information Cleaning**: Clean and process delivery information.
- **Missing Values Handling**: Remove missing values to improve data accuracy.

## Visualization and Analysis
The analysis focuses on four main aspects:
1. Distribution of discounted sale prices on Coupang.
2. Relationship between product popularity and sale price.
3. Consumer purchasing patterns in relation to product discount rates.
4. The relationship between discount rates and the number of reviews.

## Findings
- **Pricing and Popularity**: No consistent link between the number of reviews and lower prices.
- **Discounts and Consumer Behavior**: Mid-range discounts are not always indicative of higher popularity.
- **Delivery Times and Product Ratings**: Longer delivery times correlate with lower product ratings.

The study underscores the complex interplay between pricing, discounts, delivery efficiency, and product selection in consumer purchasing decisions.
